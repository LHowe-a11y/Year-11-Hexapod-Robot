OpenCV Red Detection is outdated, use the multi method one instead. 

Put it in Freenove Directory, then /Code/Server

# Also, the code in the multi method file is slightly different from the code that was used in the final robot challenge task demonstration:
We updated the leniency value and the values for how far the robot turns.
